## Summary

[CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) is a Kubernetes API that creates Job object on a schedule specified by a cron spec. It is in beta status since v1.8. This document lays out the plan to promote it to stable.

## Motivation

CronJob is useful to run periodic tasks using cron like facility in a kubernetes cluster. Its `.spec` has been stable for the last few releases. We feel the API with additional `.status` information is ready to be promoted to Stable and be supported longterm by the community. 

## Goals

- Write a new controller which will
  - Use informers instead of polling
  - Address open issues with the current controller
  - Add metrics exposing controller throughput, latency etc.
- Extend CronJob status field
  - lastSuccessfulTime: tracks the last time the job completed successfully
  - nextRunTime: tracks the next time the job will be scheduled

## Proposal

### Develop new CronJob controller

#### Existing controller

The current implementation of the CronJob controller is different that the other workload controllers. GA workload controllers use informers and caches to reduce the load on API server. Whereas the cronjob controller does a periodic poll and sweep of all the objects and acts on them. The CronJob controller has only one worker doing this.

1. syncs all CronJob objects [every 10 seconds](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/cronjob/cronjob_controller.go#L98). 
2. Using pager library, gets all Pods and all CronJobs and [processes them one by one](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/cronjob/cronjob_controller.go#L136)

This is not a scalable design and ends up loading the API server. Also this does not follow the [recommended guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-api-machinery/controllers.md) for building controllers.

#### Proposed rearchitect

With proposed rearchitecture we aim to:
1. Reduce the potential scale issues when using lots of CronJob objects
2. Reduce load on API server in such cases.
3. Reduce memory usage

##### Informers and Caches
To reduce the need to list all Jobs and CronJobs frequently to reconcile, we propose to replace it with an Informers and WorkQueue based architecture. We would be sharing the [same informer cache](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kube-controller-manager/app/controllermanager.go#L450) as the Job controller uses. 

We will follow a controller structure similar to existing workload controllers and as [outlined in the guideline](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-api-machinery/controllers.md#rough-structure).
```golang

// 
type CronJobController struct {
	kubeClient 			clientset.Interface
	queue	   			workqueue.RateLimitingInterface
	recorder   			record.EventRecorder
	
	jobControl 			jobControlInterface
	cronJobControl  		cronJobControlInterface
	
	jobLister  			batchv1listers.JobLister
	cronJobLister 			CronJobLister
	
	jobListerSynced 		cache.InformerSynced
	cronJobListerSynced		cache.InformerSynced
}

// CronJobControllerConfiguration contains controller config
type CronJobControllerConfiguration struct {
	// concurrentCronJobSyncs is the number of cronjob objects that are
	// allowed to sync concurrently. Larger number = more responsive
	// but more CPU (and network) load.
	ConcurrentCronJobSyncs int32
}


// Controller code

func (cjc *CronJobController)  Run() {
	...
	if !cache.WaitForNamedCacheSync("cronjob", stopCh, cjc.jobListerSynced, cjc.cronJobListerSynced) {
		return
	}
    // start multiple workers
    for i := 0; i < workers; i++ {
        go wait.Until(cjc.worker, time.Second, stopCh)
    }
...
}

func (cjc *CronJobController) func worker() {
    for cjc.processNextWorkItem() {}
}

func (cjc *CronJobController) func processNextWorkItem() {
	key, quit := cjc.queue.Get()
	if quit {
		return false
	}
	defer cjc.queue.Done(key)
	if err := cjc.sync(key.(string)); err != nil {
		utilruntime.HandleError(fmt.Errorf("Error syncing CronJobController %v, requeuing: %v", key.(string), err))
		cjc.queue.AddRateLimited(key)
	} else {
		cjc.queue.Forget(key)
	}
	return true
}

func (cjc *CronJobController)  sync(cronJobKey) {
	childrenJobs := cjc.jobLister.GetJobsForCronJob(cronJobKey)
	// reuse/refactor the existing syncOne function
}
```

##### Multiple workers
We also propose to have multiple workers controller by a flag similar to [statefulset controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kube-controller-manager/app/apps.go#L65). The default would be set to 5 similar to [statefulset](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/statefulset/config/v1alpha1/defaults.go#L34)

##### Handling Cron aspect
To detect which CronJob has met its schedule and need to create Jobs we need to implement a timer component. We shall implement a Heap based timer algorithm. We will introduce a separate queue with the [`DelayingInterface`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/util/workqueue/delaying_queue.go#L37) that implements heap based single shot api [`AddAfter`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/util/workqueue/delaying_queue.go#L150). Every time we process an entry from this queue, we will add it back to the queue to simulate a periodic timer.

4. [Go timerwheel](https://github.com/RussellLuo/timingwheel)

##### Metrics
We propose to add metrics that could expose the performance and health of the controller including and not limited to: 
- Skew (actualJobCreationTime-expectedJobCreationTime) - [Histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram)
- Job failures - [Gauge](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter)
- Job successes - [Gauge](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter)
- API server errors - [Gauge](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter)
- Job scheduling latency (podCreationTime - jobCreationTime) - [Histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram)
- Queue depth (pending CronJob and Job entries in the Queue) - [Gauge](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge)

Queue depth can be surfaced from existing controller framework.

### Add .status.lastSuccessfulTime
[#issue/75674](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/75674)  
Add `lastSuccessfulTime` to `.status` that tracks the last time the job completed successfully. This will augment the `lastScheduledTime` available in the `.status` in the v1beta1 api. Potential use is in monitoring (e.g. fire an alert if lastSuccessfulTime is more than X ago).


### Add .status.nextScheduleTime
[#issue/78564](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78564)
Add `nextScheduleTime` to `.status` that tracks the next time the job will be scheduled. This may not be accurate with `Forbid` concurrency policy. This only tracks the `Job` creation time and not the actual `Pod` creation time.

| Concurrency policy | notes |
|:----------|:----------|
| Allow   | `nextScheduleTime` would be accurate within a margin of controller scheduling jitter |
| Forbid  |  `nextScheduleTime` would not be accurate if the previous `Job` takes longer than the cron interval time |
| Replace | `nextScheduleTime` would be accurate within a margin of controller scheduling jitter along with older concurrent `Job` cleanup if applicable. |



### Add Counters
These counters would be added to `.status` section of the CronJob object:
- `SuccessfulRuns` Count of all successful runs
- `FailedRuns` Count of all failed runs
- `FailuresSinceSuccess` Count of failed runs since last successful



### Add .status.conditions
Add a condition array with `Settled` condition type. This would help with the effort of standarizng conditions across all core types. `Settled` is set at the end of every successful reconcile run. The key thing to note here is the notions of `Settled` does not imply the `Job`s are running correctly. It just means that the controller is done processing this object successfully.


### Support Jitter for cronjobs
We propose to introduce `.spec.jitter` which is a percentage of the time delta to the next schedule. We propose to cap it to 50%. There is also a [community request](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2440) for this.

```golang
delta = nextScheduleTime - currentTime
jitter = delta*cronjob.Spec.Jitter/100
nextScheduleTime += jitter
```

### Support Timezone for cronjobs
We propose to introduce `.spec.timezone` which indicates the timezone to be considered when scheduling this cronjob.

Clusters across different environments have different timezones. There is no known recommendation or conformance test to define timezone for the master. Different distributions may have different behavior. For cronjob, the timezone is inferred from the master. Someone with just API access has no idea what that controller manager timezone is. Sometimes cluster operators too, who run the controller manager in a container with a UTC timezone on a host with a non-UTC timezone.

These conditions imply that people with just API access who want to predict when their job will run have no guarantee. By providing a timezone field we provide an absolute value instead of relying on the relative timezone of where the master is running. This ensures more portabulity of the CronJob configs across clusters as well.

This is an optional field and when not present reverts to existing behavior of using the master's timezone.



### Fix applicable open issues
These are the [current](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/82659) list of issues that are being targeted for GA. 

- [Updating a cronjob causes jobs to be scheduled retroactively](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/63371)
- [CLI: Updated CronJob Schedule Missing from Dry Run](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/73613)
- [Kubernetes CronJob pods is not getting clean-up when Job is completed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/74741)
- [Infinite ImagePullBackOff CronJob results in resource leak](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/76570)
- [Cronjob `spec.schedule` cannot be change when `spec.schedule` value not `"` or `’`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78646)
- [Kubelet CPU/Memory Usage linearly increases using CronJob](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/64137)
- [Stopping cluster overnight prevents scheduled jobs from running after cluster startup](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/42649)
- [Fix CronJob missed start time handling](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81557)

### Scale Targets for GA

The scale targets for CronJob GA API shall conform to existing [SLIs/SLOs of Kubernetes native types](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos).

The targets are defined by the below suggested maximum limits, which are organized the same way as the [Kubernetes native type thresholds](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md#kubernetes-thresholds).

#### CronJob Limits
There should be nothing in the implementation that limits CronJobs per namespace. Overall clusterwide limits of CronJob are important. Cluster wide limits for CronJob should be storage bound since it shares the storage space with all other objects. Determining the appropriate storage limit for a cluster is out-of-scope for this document. For large clusters we propose to support 10000 CronJobs.

#### Frequency of launched jobs
The number of CronJobs is also sensitive to the API server QPS and the schedule of the individual CronJobs. This translates to the frequency of launched jobs. We could have large number of CronJobs with a spread of schedule that doenst stress the Job API. At the same time we could have a small number of CronJobs that schedule synchronously stressing the Jobs API. The design must be able to easily saturate the API server QPS. The user can setup ratelimits for CronJob and Job APIs using [API Server ratelimting config](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#eventratelimit).

}
```

## v1beta1 changes
All the new fields describedin the v1 section would be introduced in the v1beta1 API as well.


## Validations
Nothing additional from v1beta1

## Plan for promoting CronJob to GA

To promote to GA we would create `batch/v1/CronJob` in the [batch/v1 API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/api/batch/v1/types.go). The older versions of CronJob API (batch/v1beta1, batch/v2alpha1) will be deprecated following the [deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/) 

We shall have dual implementation of controller (old and new) co-exist. 
Through a feature flag the new controller implementation is controlled. 
- alpha (disabled, can be enabled)
- beta(enabled, can be disabled)
- ga(enabled, cannot be disabled)

API will track the controller since GAing the API implies GAing the scalable implementation of the API. 



## Tests

### E2E test
CronJob E2E test code is [located here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/e2e/apps/cronjob.go)

#### Existing test cases

  - Measure scheduling skew, podCreationLatency and check if it meets epxectation (To Be Defined)
- Start Stop Tests
  - Schedule cronjobs and randomly stop the controller and start it.
  - Schedule cronjobs and stop the controller and start it after the deadline.



### Conformance Tests
The conformance tests are a subset of e2e tests. We will select test scenarios that we believe are expected from all conforming clusters. Then modify the test case to use the `framework.ConformanceIt()` function rather than the `framework.It()` function. 
These e2e tests shall be included in conformance tests:

- ConcurrencyPolicy
  - should schedule multiple jobs concurrently when AllowConcurrent
  - should not schedule new jobs when ForbidConcurrent
  - should replace jobs when ReplaceConcurrent
- Suspend
  - should not schedule jobs when suspended
- SuccessfulJobsHistoryLimit
  - should delete successful finished jobs when above successfulJobsHistoryLimit
- FailedJobsHistoryLimit
  - should delete failed finished jobs when above failedJobsHistoryLimit
- StartingDeadlineSeconds
  - Should schedule a job soon when missed the current window if StartingDeadlineSeconds is long
- Tests covering Bug fixes
  - [issue/63371 - Should not start “missed” jobs from old cronjob after updating time](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/63371)
- Start Stop Tests
  - Schedule cronjobs and randomly stop the controller and start it.
  - Schedule cronjobs and stop the controller and start it after the deadline.


### Unit Tests
This is subject to the new rearchitected controller implementation. Overall these scenarios would be tested.

- [Run or Not](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/cronjob/cronjob_controller_test.go#L167) tests the controller under different scenarios to check if the Job is created or not
- [Validates Job cleanup](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/cronjob/cronjob_controller_test.go#L371) path of the controller under different conditions.
- [Validates Status](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/cronjob/cronjob_controller_test.go#L593) of the CronJob after sync under different conditions.


## Implementation plan
#### Release X
- Alpha: Feature flag for new controller is disabled by default
- Dual controller. Both old and new implementation co-exist
- API will track the controller since GAing the API implies GAing scalable implementation

#### Release X+1
- Beta: Feature flag for new controller is enabled by default. If the distribution chooses it can be disabled

#### Release X+2
- GA: The feature flag is deprecated and the old controller code is cleaned up

## Graduation Criteria

- [ ] Implement shared informers to reduce pressure on API Server
- [ ] Pass conformance tests
- [ ] Update documents reflecting the changes
- [ ] Pass CronJob e2e tests
- [ ] Pass CronJob unit-tests
- [ ] Pass scale tests

## Implementation History

- CronJob was introduced in Kubernetes 1.3 as ScheduledJobs
- In Kubernetes 1.8 it was renamed to CronJob and promoted to Beta

## Alternatives and Further Reading
 
#### Cron Aspect
To detect which CronJob has met its schedule and need to create Jobs we need to implement a timer component. These are the possible options for implementing the timer:

| algorithm  | how it works | notes |
|:----------|:----------|:-------|
| Unordered timer list | Periodic Sweep from cache | Slower and similar to existing implementation. But improved because we sweep fom the cache instead of API server | 
|Ordered timer list| Maintain ordered list of Cronjob keys and next time of expiry. Keep starting a timer with the earliest expiry. | Efficient. Reinsertion to list takes O(n) |
|Timer trees| Instead of ordered list use a sorted binary tree. | More efficient. Insertion is O(log n) |
|Heap based timer|A variant of ordered timer list where heap is used to store the next expiry time | Efficient compared to ordered list. Bookkeeping and insertion is O(log n). |
|Simple Timing wheels| circular buffer of MaxTimeOut slots. List of expiring timers at each slot. | Works for small bounded  MaxTimeOut which is not our case. Insertion and removal is O(1) via indexing |
|Hashed Wheel| Hash expiring time and insert in a hash table with linked list at each index | Bookkeeping is O(1) and worst case insertion is O(n) |
|Hierarchical Wheel| multiple timer wheels for different resolutions (Seconds, minutes, hours, days). When seconds rolls over we grab the next minutes timers and recreate the seconds wheel. similarly for minutes and hours. | Sharding at different hierarchy levels improves insertion and bookkeeping performance. |
